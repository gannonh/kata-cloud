# Resolve browser-task sequencing and next action

Resolve the dependency gate for browser preview work and define the exact resume path.

## Scope
In scope: dependency decision between context/run-history completion and browser task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f`.
Out of scope: implementing browser code changes in this step.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- [Add in-app browser preview for local development](intent://local/task/22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f)

## Definition of Done
- Browser task state is either moved forward with clear prerequisites satisfied or remains waiting with explicit blocker text.
- Spec includes a single unambiguous next action.

## Verification
- Cross-check statuses of run-history and context tasks.
- Update task and spec state consistently.

## Resolution (2026-02-17)

**Summary (Turn 1)**
Browser sequencing is resolved from current task states: browser task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f` must remain `waiting`.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ Current run-history closure state is verified (`374e17d5-6ac8-42ff-b943-66026957a892` is still `in_progress`).
- ✅ Current context closure state is verified (`76dd55a0-e87d-4fc5-82bc-7878efc81bd5` completed with NO-GO; underlying context task `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73` is `in_progress`).
- ✅ One unambiguous browser next action and prerequisite gate are defined.

**Required Prerequisite State (Gate)**
Both conditions must be true before browser task resume:
1. Run-history closure task `374e17d5-6ac8-42ff-b943-66026957a892` reaches a terminal closure outcome (`complete`) with explicit GO/NO-GO recorded.
2. Context task `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73` posts missing delivery artifacts (commit delta, successful push, remote ref, and test output) and is no longer blocked for closure.

**Single Next Action**
Keep browser task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f` in `waiting` and execute closure of run-history/context gates first; only after both gate conditions are met should browser task be resumed.

- Task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f`

**Learnings**
When closure ownership is duplicated, lock sequencing decisions to persisted task-note status/state rather than transient agent commentary.

**Changes**
- Note update only (no repository code/file edits).

**Verification**
- Cross-checked task metadata and closure evidence from task notes and active-agent conversations per this task’s verification plan.
- No shell verification commands were required for this sequencing-only decision.
