# Recover pre-reset work into current workspace

Bring commits from `kata-cloud.pre-reset.20260216-185251` into the current clean clone and establish a working branch for continuation.

## Scope
In scope: fetch from backup repo path, create/switch recovery branch in current workspace, validate commit parity with backup HEAD.
Out of scope: code changes unrelated to recovery.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- Backup repo path: `/Users/gannonhall/intent/workspaces/following-build-2/kata-cloud.pre-reset.20260216-185251`

## Definition of Done
- Recovery branch exists in current workspace and matches backup HEAD.
- Workspace is on recovered branch with clean working tree.
- Recovery evidence is logged in this task note.

## Verification
- `git fetch /Users/gannonhall/intent/workspaces/following-build-2/kata-cloud.pre-reset.20260216-185251 fe3e028e5b5e7d7d273e011d5ae7e5483640b94c:refs/heads/recovered/git-stability-incident`
- `git switch recovered/git-stability-incident`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git status --short --branch`
- `git log --oneline -n 5`

## Execution Evidence (2026-02-17)

1. Recovery fetch and branch creation succeeded after zsh refspec fix using braces: `git fetch "$BACKUP" "${REC_SHA}:refs/heads/${REC_BRANCH}"`.
2. Recovery checkout succeeded: `git switch recovered/git-stability-incident`.
3. Commit parity confirmed locally at recovered tip: `fe3e028e5b5e7d7d273e011d5ae7e5483640b94c`.
4. Repository health on recovered state was clean: `git fsck --full` completed without invalid refs; `git count-objects -vH` reported `garbage: 0`; `git worktree list --porcelain` showed only the active workspace worktree.
5. Remote publication of full recovered pack failed repeatedly on transport/unpack corruption, then recovery content was published on resume branch via fresh-clone fallback path at `origin/feature/run-history-persistence` commit `be71982fc9e214b689eb529d3e9b2cb1f4d9b99c`.
6. Local branch is now aligned to and tracking `origin/feature/run-history-persistence`.
