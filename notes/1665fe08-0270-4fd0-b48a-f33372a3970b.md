# Re-run Wave 1.6 gate and issue GO/NO-GO

Run full quality-gate verification after blocker remediation and publish final readiness decision.

## Scope
In scope: verification-only execution and severity-ranked findings.
Out of scope: additional code implementation.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- [Wave 1.5 final verifier](intent://local/task/e7be8fb9-0d21-4a8b-9cfd-0ad2686a3f77)

## Definition of Done
- Required command set is executed with captured results.
- Report includes explicit GO/NO-GO and P0/P1/P2 findings.
- Classification distinguishes baseline debt vs configuration defects.

## Verification
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`
- `pnpm run test --coverage`

## Wave 1.6 Checkpoint (Typecheck Blockers) — 2026-02-16

### Scope Verified
- Task `5b77a62f-6498-4828-824d-2125eb190d7b` (JSX namespace fixes)
- Task `2e038cd9-c58e-4aed-a0c4-9ad74f812d01` (GitCli mock typing fixes)

### Commands Run
- `pnpm run desktop:typecheck` -> PASS (exit 0)
- `pnpm run test -- git` -> PASS (exit 0)

### Error Signature Check
- No remaining `TS2503` diagnostics in scoped JSX files.
- No remaining `TS2739` diagnostics in scoped git test files.

### Scope Containment Evidence
`git diff --name-only` currently shows tracked modifications in:
- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- `src/features/spec-panel/spec-note-panel.tsx`
- `src/git/space-git-service.node.test.ts`
- `src/git/space-git-service.test.ts`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `vitest.config.ts`

For this checkpoint’s two tasks, code diffs are present only in the four scoped files:
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/features/spec-panel/spec-note-panel.tsx`
- `src/git/space-git-service.node.test.ts`
- `src/git/space-git-service.test.ts`

Additional modified files are treated as pre-existing/unrelated wave work (coverage/CI gate work), not regressions from these two typecheck-blocker tasks.

### Wave 1 GO/NO-GO (Checkpoint)
- **GO for Wave 1.6 Wave 1 (typecheck-blocker scope).**
- Remaining Wave 1.6 blockers (if any) are outside this checkpoint scope (coverage/CI alignment tasks).

## Wave 1.6 Checkpoint (Coverage Scope + Command Path) — 2026-02-16

### Scope Verified
- Task `60b297b2-5822-4b44-8d0e-d19423d31e1e` (coverage scope and deterministic command-path alignment).

### Verifier Outcome
- **GO for proceeding to Task `37ba3a25-ba14-415c-b029-a9c1bc73f2fe`**.
- No configuration defects found in coverage thresholds or command wiring.

### Evidence Highlights
- `vitest.config.ts` thresholds remain unchanged: statements `80`, branches `70`, functions `80`, lines `80`.
- Local and CI command path aligned to `pnpm run test --coverage`.
- `pnpm run test --coverage` fails due to expected baseline coverage debt while threshold enforcement remains active.
- Coverage artifacts were cleaned after verification (`coverage/` not left in working tree).

### Risk Classification
- Remaining blocker is **coverage debt remediation**, not gate configuration.

## Wave 1.6 Checkpoint (Coverage Remediation) — 2026-02-16

### Scope Verified
- Task `37ba3a25-ba14-415c-b029-a9c1bc73f2fe` (Raise global coverage metrics to passing thresholds).

### Required Checks
1. Task-note closeout evidence completeness/consistency: **PASS**.
   - Baseline metrics in task note: `75.67 / 72.30 / 83.07 / 75.67`.
   - Current metrics in task note: `80.91 / 74.25 / 84.67 / 80.91`.
   - Delta math is internally consistent: `+5.24 / +1.95 / +1.60 / +5.24`.
   - Changed-file list and `pnpm test` result are explicitly recorded in the task note.
2. `pnpm run test --coverage` with enforced thresholds `80/70/80/80`: **PASS** (exit `0`).
3. `pnpm test`: **PASS** (exit `0`, `14` files / `39` tests passing).
4. No `coverage/` artifacts left after verification: **FAIL** (`coverage/` exists and is untracked after verification run).
5. No CI/Dependabot threshold/config regressions introduced in this wave: **PASS**.
   - Thresholds in `vitest.config.ts` remain `statements 80`, `branches 70`, `functions 80`, `lines 80`.
   - CI command path remains aligned in `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml`: `lint`, `desktop:typecheck`, `test --coverage`.
   - Dependabot config still targets `npm` and `github-actions` in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

### Severity-Ranked Findings
- **P1**: `coverage/` artifact left in working tree after verification (`?? coverage/`).
  - Impact: Fails required hygiene check for this checkpoint and can pollute follow-up gate verification state.
  - Minimal fix: remove generated `coverage/` directory, then re-run artifact check (`git status --short`).

### Baseline vs Scope Classification
- Baseline/unrelated workspace state includes existing modified/untracked files outside this checkpoint scope (`src/main.tsx`, `src/features/spec-panel/spec-note-panel.tsx`, `.github/`, `eslint.config.mjs`, etc.).
- No evidence of new CI/Dependabot threshold/config regressions introduced by Task `37ba3a25-ba14-415c-b029-a9c1bc73f2fe`.

### Checkpoint Decision
- **NO-GO** for proceeding to final Wave 1.6 gate task `1665fe08-0270-4fd0-b48a-f33372a3970b` until `coverage/` artifact cleanup is completed and rechecked.

### Command Evidence
- `pnpm run test --coverage` -> PASS (exit `0`), coverage summary: `80.91 / 74.25 / 84.67 / 80.91`.
- `pnpm test` -> PASS (exit `0`), `14` files and `39` tests passed.
- `git status --short` -> FAIL for artifact hygiene (`?? coverage/`).

## Wave 1.6 Coverage Remediation Re-check — 2026-02-16

Scope: verification-only re-check for task `37ba3a25-ba14-415c-b029-a9c1bc73f2fe` after prior artifact-hygiene NO-GO.

Required checks executed:
1. `pnpm run test --coverage` -> PASS (exit `0`).
   - Coverage summary: statements `80.91`, branches `74.31`, functions `84.67`, lines `80.91`.
   - Thresholds confirmed enforced at `80/70/80/80` in `vitest.config.ts`.
2. `pnpm test` -> PASS (exit `0`).
   - Result: `14` test files, `39` tests passed.
3. `git status --short | rg 'coverage/' || echo 'NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES'` -> FAIL.
   - Output: `?? coverage/`.
   - Prior NO-GO condition (coverage artifact hygiene) remains unresolved in current rerun.
4. CI/Dependabot regression check in scope -> PASS.
   - `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml` still runs `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`, `pnpm run test --coverage`.
   - `.github/dependabot.yml` still configures weekly updates for `npm` and `github-actions`.
   - No evidence of threshold regression from `80/70/80/80`.

Severity-ranked findings:
- P1: Coverage artifact hygiene still failing (`?? coverage/` present after verification run).
- P2: Non-blocking warning in test logs (`ReactDOMTestUtils.act` deprecation) observed; not part of Wave 1.6 gate acceptance criteria.

Decision for proceeding to final Wave 1.6 task `1665fe08-0270-4fd0-b48a-f33372a3970b`:
- **NO-GO** (artifact-hygiene criterion not satisfied in this re-check).

Re-verify commands after cleanup:
- `pnpm run test --coverage`
- `pnpm test`
- `git status --short | rg 'coverage/' || echo 'NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES'`

## Wave 1.6 Final Gate Verification — 2026-02-16 (Final Re-run)

### Artifact Hygiene Evidence (required command output)
1. Pre-clean check
   - Command: `git status --short | rg 'coverage/' || echo 'NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES'`
   - Output: `?? coverage/`
2. Post-pre-clean check (after removing `coverage/`)
   - Command: `git status --short | rg 'coverage/' || echo 'NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES'`
   - Output: `NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES`
3. Final post-run check (after removing generated `coverage/`)
   - Command: `git status --short | rg 'coverage/' || echo 'NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES'`
   - Output: `NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES`

### Commands Run (exact required order)
1. `pnpm install` → PASS (exit `0`)
2. `pnpm run lint` → PASS (exit `0`)
   - Note: 1 warning in `src/main.tsx` from `react-refresh/only-export-components` (warning only, not gate-failing)
3. `pnpm run desktop:typecheck` → PASS (exit `0`)
4. `pnpm run test --coverage` → PASS (exit `0`)
   - Test result: `14` files, `39` tests passed
   - Coverage summary: statements `80.91`, branches `74.25`, functions `84.67`, lines `80.91`

### Acceptance Criteria Pass/Fail
1. `pnpm run desktop:typecheck` exits `0` with no `TS2503` or `TS2739` failures.
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: command exited `0`; no `TS2503`/`TS2739` diagnostics in output.
2. `pnpm run test --coverage` exits `0` with thresholds enforced at `80/70/80/80`.
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: command exited `0`; coverage values above thresholds; `vitest.config.ts` thresholds are `80/70/80/80`.
3. CI workflow command path remains aligned to local gates (`lint`, `desktop:typecheck`, `test --coverage`).
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml` contains `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`, `pnpm run test --coverage`.
4. Final verification note records an explicit GO/NO-GO and severity-ranked residual risks.
   - **PASS**
   - Evidence: this section includes explicit decision and ranked findings.

### Severity-ranked Findings (P0/P1/P2)
- **P0:** None.
- **P1:** None.
- **P2:** Lint warning (`react-refresh/only-export-components`) and React `act` deprecation warnings observed during tests. These do not fail current Wave 1.6 acceptance gates.

### Baseline Debt vs Configuration Defect Classification
- **Baseline debt:**
  - Lint/test warning noise (`react-refresh` warning, `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` deprecation warnings).
- **Configuration defects:**
  - None observed in this final re-run.

### Final Decision
- **GO** for Wave 1.6 acceptance criteria.
- Rationale: required gate commands all passed in order, coverage thresholds are met/enforced, CI command path remains aligned, and coverage artifacts were cleaned with final check output `NO_COVERAGE_ENTRIES`.
