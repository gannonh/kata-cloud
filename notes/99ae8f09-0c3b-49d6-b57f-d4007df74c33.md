# Reconcile branch hygiene and preserve runtime remediation scope

Ensure branch diffs/commits are clean after cache cleanup while preserving intended runtime/source changes for active Wave 1.2 work.

## Scope
In scope: branch diff hygiene, scoped commit reconciliation, and explicit handling decision for `.npmrc` (`commit` vs `ignore`) based on runtime needs.
Out of scope: new product features.

## Inputs
[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
Active runtime task: [Unblock Electron runtime install for dev startup](intent://local/task/fe99cd34-6c78-45e5-b3b2-a60cebae3faf)

## Definition of Done
- Branch no longer contains accidental `.pnpm-store/**` diffs.
- Intended runtime/source changes remain intact and reviewable.
- `.npmrc` handling is documented in task note and aligned with project policy: commit `.npmrc`.

## Verification
- `git diff --name-only origin/unblock-wave-1-verification...HEAD`
- `git status --short`
- `git log --oneline --decorate -n 10`

## Implementation Evidence (2026-02-16)

### Summary
Branch hygiene is reconciled with no new repository edits required in this task. Intended runtime/source changes remain in scope, `.npmrc` remains committed per policy, and `.pnpm-store/**` tracking/diff noise is still absent.

### What Changed
- No code or config edits were made by this task.
- No scoped commit was needed; existing hygiene commit `b894f0e` already covers cache-untracking/ignore reconciliation.

### Files Touched (This Task)
- Task note only: `99ae8f09-0c3b-49d6-b57f-d4007df74c33`

### Required Verification Evidence
Command: `git diff --name-only origin/unblock-wave-1-verification...HEAD`
Output:
```text
.gitignore
.npmrc
package.json
src/git/space-git-service.node.test.ts
src/git/space-git-service.ts
src/git/types.node.test.ts
```

Command: `git status --short`
Output:
```text
<no output>
```

Command: `git log --oneline --decorate -n 10`
Output:
```text
b894f0e (HEAD -> fix-git-ignore-hygiene) Untrack .pnpm-store cache artifacts and harden cache ignores
650560e Agent changes
a95e9d3 Agent changes
c7bb2cf (origin/unblock-wave-1-verification) chore: checkpoint wave 1 and wave 1.1 remediation progress
76519ee (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main, kata-cloud-product-spec, kata-cloud-product-planning) first commit
```

### Additional Sanity Checks
Command: `git ls-files .pnpm-store | wc -l`
Output:
```text
0
```

Command: `git diff --name-only origin/unblock-wave-1-verification...HEAD | rg '^\.pnpm-store/' || true`
Output:
```text
<no output>
```

### Scope Preservation Confirmation
Preserved intended runtime/source edits remain reviewable in branch diff:
- `package.json`
- `.npmrc` (committed per policy)
- `src/git/space-git-service.ts`
- `src/git/space-git-service.node.test.ts`
- `src/git/types.node.test.ts`
