# Verify and close run-history task

Validate the existing implementation evidence for run-history persistence and move the task to a final verified state.

## Scope
In scope: task note `c5f554ea-2059-40d2-9fb2-bf522a590cae`, verifier delegation, status updates in spec.
Out of scope: new implementation changes.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- [Persist and display orchestrator run history across sessions](intent://local/task/c5f554ea-2059-40d2-9fb2-bf522a590cae)

## Definition of Done
- Verifier issues GO/NO-GO with findings.
- Task status is updated to `complete` or sent back with explicit remediation items.
- Spec records the final result.

## Verification
- Review task evidence in note.
- Run verifier delegation and record outcome.

## Closure Outcome (2026-02-17)

Recommendation for run-history task `c5f554ea-2059-40d2-9fb2-bf522a590cae`: **NO-GO**.

What was validated:
1. Run-history task note includes implementation artifact claims (files changed, automated checks, branch/commit).
2. Remote head check passed for `feature/run-history-persistence-fix` at `4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`.

Evidence gaps that block GO:
1. No recorded verifier GO/NO-GO closeout for `c5f...`.
2. Manual restart persistence verification remains explicitly blocked/unexecuted.
3. Independent local inspection of commit `4d388ce...` was incomplete in this workspace (`git show` failed with `bad object`; fetch-based follow-up was not completed in this session).

Verification commands run in this closure pass:
1. `git branch --show-current` -> `feature/context-adapter-foundation`
2. `git rev-parse HEAD` -> `1cadf1894f3a37d520c106af590ef102f8ce8f77`
3. `git show --name-only --pretty=format: 4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6` -> `fatal: bad object 4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`
4. `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/run-history-persistence-fix` -> remote head exists at `4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`

Status action:
- `c5f554ea-2059-40d2-9fb2-bf522a590cae` remains `in_progress` pending remediation.
