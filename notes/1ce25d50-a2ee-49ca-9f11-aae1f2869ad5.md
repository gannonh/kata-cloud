# Prepare external-outsource handoff package

Prepare explicit instructions for your external outsourcing action, starting with the changes-tab task.

## Scope
In scope: handoff packet for `e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d` and queued follow-on `10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c`.
Out of scope: performing external delegation ourselves.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- [Build changes tab with diff inspection and selective staging](intent://local/task/e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d)
- [Add GitHub PR creation workflow in Changes tab](intent://local/task/10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c)

## Definition of Done
- You receive copy/paste instructions for external agent delegation (scope, branch, required tests, evidence format).
- Handoff sequence (first task, then next task) is explicit.

## Verification
- Manual review of handoff text for clarity and completeness.

## Summary (Turn 1)
Prepared a ready-to-send external outsourcing handoff packet in required order: first `e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d`, then `10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c`. Packet includes scope boundaries, branch instructions from updated `main`, required verification commands, and strict evidence format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Provide copy/paste delegation instructions for `e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d`.
- ✅ Provide copy/paste delegation instructions for `10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c`.
- ✅ Make sequencing explicit: first changes tab, then PR workflow.
- ✅ Include scope, branch, verification commands, and evidence format for each.

## Subtasks
- None.

## References

- [Build changes tab with diff inspection and selective staging](intent://local/task/e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d)
- [Add GitHub PR creation workflow in Changes tab](intent://local/task/10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c)

## Learnings
- Keep external packets constrained to task note DoD/verification lines to prevent scope creep.

## External Outsource Handoff Packet

### Step 1 (send first): Task `e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d`

```text
Task: Build changes tab with diff inspection and selective staging
Task ID: e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d

Scope (in):
- Implement Changes tab UI/logic for file diffs in a space.
- Add per-file stage/unstage controls.
- Show accurate staged summary/state in app.

Scope (out):
- No GitHub PR creation flow.
- No final git merge flow changes.
- No unrelated refactors.

Branch requirements:
1) Sync main and branch from updated main only.
   - git fetch origin
   - git switch main
   - git pull --ff-only origin main
   - git switch -c feature/changes-tab-diff-staging
2) Keep work isolated to this task and open a PR back to main.

Required verification commands:
- pnpm run test -- changes
- pnpm run desktop:typecheck

Required manual verification:
- Modify files in a space, inspect diffs in Changes tab, stage/unstage selected files, confirm status matches CLI git status.

Required evidence format (post back):
1) Summary: 3-6 bullets of delivered behavior.
2) Files changed: exact paths.
3) Verification:
   - Command: <command>
   - Result: PASS/FAIL
   - Key output: <1-3 lines>
4) Manual validation notes: steps + observed outcome.
5) Git evidence:
   - Branch name
   - Commit SHA
   - PR URL
6) Risks/follow-ups: explicit list or "None".
```

### Step 2 (send only after Step 1 is complete): Task `10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c`

```text
Task: Add GitHub PR creation workflow in Changes tab
Task ID: 10a48d6c-9fd1-452f-aa99-3120bf23641c
Dependency: Start only after e1ea609a-a0d0-4025-92ea-f20564110a9d is completed and merged/synced.

Scope (in):
- Generate suggested PR title/body from staged diff + spec context.
- Allow user edits before submit.
- Submit PR via GitHub API for selected repo/branch.
- Handle auth/session + permission/repo mismatch failures with actionable messages.
- Show created PR URL and allow opening it from app.

Scope (out):
- No changes-tab diff/staging redesign beyond what PR workflow needs.
- No unrelated git plumbing refactors.

Branch requirements:
1) Start from latest main after Task 1 merge.
   - git fetch origin
   - git switch main
   - git pull --ff-only origin main
   - git switch -c feature/changes-tab-pr-workflow
2) Keep commit scope to PR workflow behavior only.

Required verification commands:
- pnpm run test -- pr-workflow
- pnpm run desktop:typecheck

Required manual verification:
- Create PR against a test repository.
- Validate suggested title/body generation from staged diff + spec context.
- Validate editable draft, submit success path, and error states.
- Validate shown PR URL opens correctly.

Required evidence format (post back):
1) Summary: 3-6 bullets of delivered behavior.
2) Files changed: exact paths.
3) Verification:
   - Command: <command>
   - Result: PASS/FAIL
   - Key output: <1-3 lines>
4) Manual validation notes: test repo used, target branches, success/error scenarios tested.
5) Git evidence:
   - Branch name
   - Commit SHA
   - PR URL
6) Risks/follow-ups: explicit list or "None".
```

## Changes
- Updated task note with final external handoff packet and sequencing.

## Verification Run
- Command: Manual review of packet against task note DoD and input task scopes
- Result: PASS
- Notes: Includes required scope, branch, verification commands, evidence format, and explicit sequencing.
