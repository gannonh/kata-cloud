# Verify and close context-adapter task

Confirm delivery artifacts and quality for context adapter work, then finalize status.

## Scope
In scope: task note `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`, missing artifact confirmation, verifier delegation.
Out of scope: net-new feature expansion.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- [Integrate context engine adapter and initial providers](intent://local/task/302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73)

## Definition of Done
- Commit/push/file-list/test evidence is present in task note.
- Verifier issues GO/NO-GO with findings.
- Task status is updated accordingly and reflected in spec.

## Verification
- Confirm artifact completeness in note.
- Delegate verifier and capture verdict.

## Closure Findings (Turn 1)

### Summary
Context-adapter delivery task `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73` is **not ready for verifier closure**. Files/tests were described in-note, but commit/push/remote-ref evidence is missing and the branch currently has uncommitted changes.

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Confirm commit/push/file-list/test evidence state for task `302fcffa-...`.
- ✅ Reconcile task status with observed evidence.
- ✅ Update notes/spec with closure recommendation and blockers.

### Evidence and Commands Run
- `git rev-parse --verify HEAD` -> `1cadf1894f3a37d520c106af590ef102f8ce8f77`.
- `git log --oneline main..feature/context-adapter-foundation` -> *(no output)*.
- `git status --short src/context src/main.tsx src/main/index.ts src/preload/index.ts src/shared/shell-api.ts src/shared/state.ts src/shared/state.test.ts` -> modified/untracked files remain.
- `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/context-adapter-foundation` -> *(no output)*.
- `find src/context -type f | sort` -> context files exist only as local working-tree files.

### Missing Artifacts Required For Closure
1. Commit hash(es) on `feature/context-adapter-foundation`.
2. Successful push output for `feature/context-adapter-foundation`.
3. Remote head confirmation line from `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/context-adapter-foundation`.
4. Attached command outputs for:
   - `pnpm run test -- context`
   - `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`

### Actions Taken
- Added a `Closure Audit (2026-02-17)` section to task note `302fcffa-...` with exact missing artifacts and required commands/outputs.
- Updated task `302fcffa-...` status from `review_required` to `in_progress`.
- Added a spec update section `Context Adapter Closure Check (2026-02-17)` documenting NO-GO and blocker state.

### References
- Task note: `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`
- Spec: `spec`

### Learnings
Prior agent narrative can overstate completion when git artifacts are missing. Closure checks must validate branch delta and remote head explicitly, not just note prose.

### Changes
- Note updated: `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`
- Note updated: `spec`
- Note updated: `76dd55a0-e87d-4fc5-82bc-7878efc81bd5`
