# Verify quality gates end-to-end and issue GO/NO-GO

Run the full quality-gate set after implementation and record final readiness.

## Scope
In scope: local command verification and explicit GO/NO-GO report.
Out of scope: additional feature implementation.

## Inputs
[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)

## Definition of Done
- Full quality-gate command set is executed with outcomes recorded.
- Final readiness decision includes any remaining blockers with severity.

## Verification
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`
- `pnpm run test --coverage`

## Verification Summary (Turn 1)

### Verdict
- **NO-GO** for Wave 1.5 final quality gate readiness on current repo state.
- Confidence: **High** (all required commands executed locally; CI/Dependabot configs inspected directly).

### Acceptance Criteria Checklist (Spec: Wave 1.5 Quality Gates)
1. ✅ VERIFIED: Lint checks are standardized and runnable locally and in CI.
- Evidence:
  - `package.json:12` defines `"lint": "eslint ."`.
  - `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml:30` runs `pnpm run lint`.
  - `pnpm run lint` exited `0` (with one warning).
- Verification: command execution + static workflow inspection.

2. ✅ VERIFIED: Coverage thresholds are explicit, enforced, and visible in CI outcomes.
- Evidence:
  - `vitest.config.ts:11-15` sets thresholds (`statements 80`, `branches 70`, `functions 80`, `lines 80`).
  - `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml:36` runs `pnpm run test --coverage`.
  - Local run produced explicit threshold failures.
- Verification: `pnpm run test --coverage` execution output confirms enforcement.

3. ✅ VERIFIED: GitHub CI runs on pull requests and merge-branch pushes with blocking quality gates.
- Evidence:
  - `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml:4` (`pull_request`) and `:5-7` (`push` to `main`).
  - Workflow runs lint/typecheck/coverage at lines `30`, `33`, `36`.
  - Non-zero commands fail job by default in GitHub Actions step execution.
- Verification: static workflow trigger + step inspection.

4. ✅ VERIFIED: Dependabot is configured for npm and GitHub Actions update automation.
- Evidence:
  - `.github/dependabot.yml:3-6` npm weekly.
  - `.github/dependabot.yml:8-11` github-actions weekly.
- Verification: static file inspection.

5. ✅ VERIFIED: Final verification provides an explicit GO/NO-GO with blocker severity.
- Evidence: this report includes explicit verdict and severity-ranked blockers/risks.
- Verification: task-note output content.

### Required Gate Commands (Executed)
- `pnpm install` -> **PASS**
- `pnpm run lint` -> **PASS** (1 warning only; non-blocking)
- `pnpm run desktop:typecheck` -> **FAIL**
  - `TS2503 Cannot find namespace 'JSX'` in `src/features/spec-panel/spec-note-panel.tsx` and `src/main.tsx`.
  - `TS2739` mock typing mismatches for `GitCli` in `src/git/space-git-service.node.test.ts` and `src/git/space-git-service.test.ts`.
- `pnpm run test --coverage` -> **FAIL**
  - Global thresholds not met: lines `47.53% < 80`, statements `47.53% < 80`, functions `78.83% < 80`.

### Configuration Verification
- CI workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci-quality-gates.yml`
  - Triggers: `pull_request` and `push` to `main`.
  - Quality-gate commands present: lint/typecheck/coverage.
- Dependabot file: `.github/dependabot.yml`
  - npm weekly and github-actions weekly schedules present.

### Blockers and Risks (Severity-Ordered)
- **P0 (Blocker):** `pnpm run desktop:typecheck` fails; quality gate blocks merge readiness.
  - Classification: **Code/type debt** (not CI config defect).
- **P0 (Blocker):** `pnpm run test --coverage` fails global enforced thresholds.
  - Classification: **Expected baseline coverage debt** under newly enforced policy (not CI config defect).
- **P1 (Risk):** Lint warning (`react-refresh/only-export-components` in `src/main.tsx`) remains; non-blocking today but indicates baseline cleanliness gap.
- **P2 (Risk):** Deprecation warnings in tests (`ReactDOMTestUtils.act`) surfaced during coverage run; non-blocking but should be tracked.

### Expected Baseline vs Configuration Defect
- **Expected baseline debt:** coverage thresholds currently fail on existing coverage profile; typecheck currently fails on existing TS issues.
- **Configuration defects found:** **None** in CI trigger wiring or Dependabot scheduling.
