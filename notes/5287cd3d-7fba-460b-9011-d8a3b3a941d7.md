# Re-run Wave 1 gate after startup stabilization

Run the full Wave 1 gate after startup stabilization changes and issue final Wave 2 GO/NO-GO with explicit blocker severity.

## Scope
In scope: verification commands, restart persistence smoke, and final gate decision.
Out of scope: implementation changes.

## Inputs
[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
Startup stabilization task: [Stabilize Electron dev startup orchestration](intent://local/task/d9a13fa0-1e1a-487b-81e7-e0e41fa9c948)

## Definition of Done
- Full command set executed with evidence.
- Restart persistence smoke executed (or explicitly blocked with rationale).
- Final report includes explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO and severity-ordered blockers/risks.

## Verification
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run test -- space`
- `pnpm run test -- git`
- `pnpm run test -- notes`
- `pnpm run test -- task-parser`
- `pnpm run dev`
- Manual: restart app and confirm space/spec persistence

## Summary (Turn 1)

Executing Wave 1.4 Task 2 as verification-only. I will run the gate command sequence exactly as listed in this task note, then run startup stabilization checks (normal and port-5173 contention) to validate deterministic renderer URL handoff and issue explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Full command set from this task note is executed with captured evidence.
- [ ] Restart persistence smoke is executed, or explicitly blocked with concrete blocker signature and rationale.
- [ ] Final decision is explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO with severity-ordered blockers/risks.
- [ ] Startup stabilization outcome from `d9a13fa0-1e1a-487b-81e7-e0e41fa9c948` is validated for both normal startup and `5173` contention.
- [ ] Verifier confirms whether `pnpm run dev` completes app boot in this environment.

## Subtasks
- None.

## Learnings

## Changes
- Verification in progress; no code changes permitted for this task.

## Summary (Turn 2)

Completed the full Wave 1 gate rerun in the exact task-note order and validated startup stabilization behavior from Task `d9a13fa0-1e1a-487b-81e7-e0e41fa9c948` under both normal startup and explicit `5173` contention. Result: deterministic renderer URL handoff is verified, but app boot still does not complete in this environment due to Electron `SIGABRT`; Wave 2 remains NO-GO.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Full command set from this task note is executed with captured evidence.
- [x] Restart persistence smoke is executed, or explicitly blocked with concrete blocker signature and rationale.
- [x] Final decision is explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO with severity-ordered blockers/risks.
- [x] Startup stabilization outcome from `d9a13fa0-1e1a-487b-81e7-e0e41fa9c948` is validated for both normal startup and `5173` contention.
- [x] Verifier confirms whether `pnpm run dev` completes app boot in this environment.

## Verification Evidence
1. `pnpm install`
```text
Lockfile is up to date, resolution step is skipped
Already up to date
Done in 324ms using pnpm v10.6.2
```
2. `pnpm run test -- space` → PASS (35 tests passed, 13 files)
3. `pnpm run test -- git` → PASS (35 tests passed, 13 files)
4. `pnpm run test -- notes` → PASS (35 tests passed, 13 files)
5. `pnpm run test -- task-parser` → PASS (35 tests passed, 13 files)
6. `pnpm run dev` (normal startup)
```text
VITE v6.4.1 ready
Local: http://127.0.0.1:5173/
[dev] Launching Electron with renderer URL: http://127.0.0.1:5173
.../Electron exited with signal SIGABRT
```
7. Startup stabilization contention validation (`5173` occupied, then `pnpm run dev`)
```text
Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...
Local: http://127.0.0.1:5174/
[dev] Launching Electron with renderer URL: http://127.0.0.1:5174
.../Electron exited with signal SIGABRT
```
8. Manual restart persistence smoke
- Blocked: app does not reach stable boot/window state because Electron exits with `SIGABRT`, so restart-and-persist behavior cannot be observed in this environment.

## Wave 2 Gate Decision
- Decision: **NO-GO**
- Severity-ordered blockers/risks:
  - **P0 Blocker:** `pnpm run dev` does not complete app boot; Electron process exits with `SIGABRT` after deterministic URL handoff.
  - **P1 Risk:** Launcher path appears to exit shell command with code 0 despite logged Electron `SIGABRT`, which can mask startup failure if only exit code is checked.
  - **P2 Risk:** Port-contention harness emits `zsh:1: nice(5) failed: operation not permitted`; non-blocking for this verification but environment noise remains.

## Learnings
- Startup orchestration is now deterministic with real Vite URL handoff (5173 and 5174 verified), but environment/runtime abort remains the gate blocker.

## Changes
- No code changes made in this verifier task.
- Evidence reviewed in `package.json`, `bin/dev-desktop.mjs`, and `src/main/index.ts`.
