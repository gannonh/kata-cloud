# Implement real model provider runtime and authentication

Add production-path model integration for Anthropic and OpenAI with both API-key and token-based authenticated sessions.

## Scope
Implement provider adapters and credential/session detection for Anthropic and OpenAI. Support API key entry/storage plus token-authenticated state detection where supported by local provider tooling/session context. Include provider selection, model listing, and request execution for orchestrator/specialists.

## Inputs
`docs/kata-cloud-ovweview.md`
`docs/kata-context.md`
`[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)`

## Definition of Done
- Anthropic and OpenAI can both execute real completion/tool requests from the app.
- User can configure API keys and use token-authenticated sessions when available.
- Auth mode and provider health are visible in settings/status UI.
- Clear fallback/error handling exists for expired or missing auth.

## Verification
- `pnpm run test -- providers`
- Manual: execute prompts against Anthropic and OpenAI using API key mode and token-authenticated mode
