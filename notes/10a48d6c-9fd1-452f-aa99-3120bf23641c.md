# Add GitHub PR creation workflow in Changes tab

Create pull requests directly from staged changes and spec context.

## Scope
Implement GitHub PR creation flow that generates a suggested title/body, lets the user edit it, and submits a PR via GitHub API for the selected repo/branch. Include auth/session handling and failure states for permission/repo mismatch cases.

## Inputs
`docs/kata-cloud-ovweview.md` section "Review, stage, and merge"
`[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)`

## Definition of Done
- User can generate suggested PR title/body from staged diff + spec context.
- User can submit a PR directly to GitHub from the app.
- Success and error states are surfaced with actionable messages.
- Created PR URL is shown and can be opened from the app.

## Verification
- `pnpm run test -- pr-workflow`
- Manual: create a PR against a test repository and validate final title/body/target branches
