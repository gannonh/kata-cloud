# Re-run Wave 1 gate after runtime remediation

Execute the full Wave 1 gate once runtime startup is fixed, including restart persistence smoke, and produce final Wave 2 GO/NO-GO.

## Scope
In scope: verification commands, restart persistence smoke, and final gate decision report.
Out of scope: implementation changes.

## Inputs
[Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
Verifier baseline: [Re-run Wave 1 gate after fixes](intent://local/task/42932726-7b8d-47a5-9ccd-fcc4aba54dcd)

## Definition of Done
- Full verification command set is executed with evidence.
- Restart persistence smoke is executed and recorded.
- Final report includes explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO and any remaining blockers.

## Verification
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run test -- space`
- `pnpm run test -- git`
- `pnpm run test -- notes`
- `pnpm run test -- task-parser`
- `pnpm run dev`
- Manual: restart app and confirm space/spec persistence

## Verifier Log (Turn 1)

### Summary
Preparing a full Wave 1.2 gate re-run against current branch state. Verification will execute the exact command list in this task note and issue explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO with blocker severity and restart persistence status.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Execute full verification command set and capture exact evidence for each command.
- [ ] Validate current runtime finding that install signature is resolved (`Electron failed to install correctly` absent as active failure).
- [ ] Determine whether `pnpm run dev` boots far enough to run restart persistence smoke; if not, record as blocked with rationale.
- [ ] Publish explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO decision with severity-ordered blockers/risks.

### Traceability Map
- Spec criterion 1 (`autosave/save converts task blocks`): evidence from task note `2c119395-f7be-4595-8e2a-98cb9d976e62` plus current `pnpm run test -- notes`.
- Spec criterion 2 (`duplicate titles produce distinct tasks`): evidence from task note `e420a91b-5bab-4df8-8074-b518a04edc46` plus current `pnpm run test -- task-parser`.
- Spec criterion 3 (`re-run evidence + GO/NO-GO`): this task note `87853fc8-3e92-428e-95da-239cbb11d698` command outputs and final verdict.

## Verifier Log (Turn 2)

### Summary
Executed the full Wave 1.2 gate command list on current branch head `b894f0e37a43f3b7c32df8159102c1db6d646566`. `pnpm install` and all four scoped test commands pass. `pnpm run dev` still fails before app startup because Electron exits with `SIGABRT`. Restart persistence smoke is therefore blocked.

### Acceptance Criteria (This Task)
- [x] Execute full verification command set and capture exact evidence for each command.
- [x] Validate install-failure signature is resolved as the active runtime error (`Electron failed to install correctly` not reproduced).
- [ ] Run restart persistence smoke.
  - Blocked: app does not reach running state due Electron process abort.
- [x] Publish explicit Wave 2 GO/NO-GO with severity-ordered blockers/risks.

### Command Evidence
- `pnpm install` → PASS (exit 0)
  - `Lockfile is up to date, resolution step is skipped`
  - `Already up to date`
  - `Done in 364ms using pnpm v10.6.2`
- `pnpm run test -- space` → PASS (exit 0)
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- git` → PASS (exit 0)
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- notes` → PASS (exit 0)
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- task-parser` → PASS (exit 0)
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run dev` → FAIL (exit 1)
  - `Electron ... exited with signal SIGABRT`
  - `wait-on tcp:5173 && electron dist/main/index.js exited with code 1`
  - `ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1`
- Runtime install-path sanity probe:
  - `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 pnpm exec electron -e "console.log(process.versions.electron)"` → PASS (`37.10.3`)
- Manual restart persistence smoke (`restart app and confirm space/spec persistence`) → BLOCKED (app never reaches launchable state)

### Traceability to Wave 1 Remediation Spec Criteria
- Criterion 1 (`Spec autosave/save converts task blocks`): supported by prior completion evidence in task note `2c119395-f7be-4595-8e2a-98cb9d976e62` and current green `pnpm run test -- notes` run.
- Criterion 2 (`Duplicate titles create distinct task records`): supported by prior completion evidence in task note `e420a91b-5bab-4df8-8074-b518a04edc46` and current green `pnpm run test -- task-parser` run.
- Criterion 3 (`Wave 1 verification rerun + explicit GO/NO-GO`): satisfied by this full rerun log and explicit gate decision below.

### Severity-Ordered Blockers / Risks
1. High: `pnpm run dev` fails before full startup due Electron process abort (`SIGABRT`).
   - Impact: blocks app-launch verification and prevents restart persistence smoke.
2. Medium: Restart persistence smoke is unverified.
   - Impact: Wave 1 acceptance criterion requiring install+run+reopen with full state restore is still unproven in this environment.
3. Low: Port contention/reliability risk during dev start (`Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...`), while dev script waits on fixed `tcp:5173` in `package.json`.
   - Impact: startup sequencing may be non-deterministic when 5173 is occupied.

### Wave 2 Gate Decision
- **NO-GO**.
- Rationale: although install and test evidence is now green, required runtime boot/persistence validation remains blocked because Electron aborts before app startup.

### Edge-Case Checks (Relevant)
- Runtime signature shift confirmed: active failure is no longer missing Electron install assets; it is a launch-time Electron abort.
- Startup orchestration risk noted for fixed `wait-on tcp:5173` when Vite auto-shifts port.

### Changes
- Verification-only task; no repository source changes.

## Verifier Log (Turn 3)

### Follow-up Coordination
- Sent structured runtime fix request to task agent `agent-2b295537-151d-4d71-89af-b2530828fe43` on task `fe99cd34-6c78-45e5-b3b2-a60cebae3faf` with repro, minimal required change, likely files, and re-verify commands.

### Changes
- Verification artifacts only (task-note updates and implementor fix request).

## Verifier Log (Turn 4)

### Event-Driven Recheck
- Observed runtime-task agent idle event (`agent-2b295537-151d-4d71-89af-b2530828fe43`) and reviewed full conversation.
- No remediation commit landed after prior gate run; branch head remains `b894f0e37a43f3b7c32df8159102c1db6d646566` and workspace remains clean.
- Re-ran runtime boot command to verify whether gate state changed.

### Commands Run (Turn 4)
- `git rev-parse HEAD && git log --oneline -n 5 && git status --short` → PASS
  - Head: `b894f0e37a43f3b7c32df8159102c1db6d646566`
  - Top commits unchanged (`b894f0e`, `650560e`, `a95e9d3`, `c7bb2cf`, `76519ee`)
  - Working tree clean.
- `pnpm run dev` → FAIL (unchanged signature)
  - `Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...`
  - `.../Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron exited with signal SIGABRT`
  - `wait-on tcp:5173 && electron dist/main/index.js exited with code 1`
  - `ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1`

### Wave 2 Gate Decision (Recheck)
- **NO-GO (unchanged).**
- Rationale: there is no new remediation commit and runtime launch still fails pre-startup, so restart persistence smoke remains blocked.

### Notes
- Prior full command-set evidence from Turn 2 remains the latest complete gate run for this head.
- This Turn 4 addendum is an event-driven state recheck only.

## Verifier Log (Turn 5)

### Full Gate Re-run (Same Head)
Executed the full Wave 1.2 verification command set again on current head `b894f0e37a43f3b7c32df8159102c1db6d646566`.

### Commands Run (Turn 5)
- `pnpm install` → PASS
  - `Lockfile is up to date, resolution step is skipped`
  - `Already up to date`
  - `Done in 358ms using pnpm v10.6.2`
- `pnpm run test -- space` → PASS
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- git` → PASS
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- notes` → PASS
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run test -- task-parser` → PASS
  - `Test Files 13 passed (13)`
  - `Tests 35 passed (35)`
- `pnpm run dev` → FAIL
  - `Port 5173 is in use, trying another one...`
  - `.../Electron.app/Contents/MacOS/Electron exited with signal SIGABRT`
  - `wait-on tcp:5173 && electron dist/main/index.js exited with code 1`
  - `ELIFECYCLE Command failed with exit code 1`
- `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 pnpm exec electron -e "console.log(process.versions.electron)"` → PASS (`37.10.3`)
- Manual restart persistence smoke → BLOCKED (app startup failed before launch)

### Severity-Ordered Blockers / Risks (Turn 5)
1. High: Electron launch abort (`SIGABRT`) prevents app startup in `pnpm run dev`.
2. Medium: Required restart persistence smoke remains blocked due startup failure.
3. Low: Dev startup orchestration risk persists (`wait-on tcp:5173` while Vite moves to 5174 when port contention occurs).

### Wave 2 Gate Decision (Turn 5)
- **NO-GO (unchanged).**
- Explicit rationale: runtime startup still fails pre-launch, so restart persistence requirement cannot be executed.
