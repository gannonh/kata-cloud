Files/tests were described in-note, but commit/push/remote-ref evidence is missing and the branch currently has uncommitted changes.\n\n### Acceptance Criteria\n- ✅ Confirm commit/push/file-list/test evidence state for task `302fcffa-...`.\n- ✅ Reconcile task status with observed evidence.\n- ✅ Update notes/spec with closure recommendation and blockers.\n\n### Evidence and Commands Run\n- `git rev-parse --verify HEAD` -> `1cadf1894f3a37d520c106af590ef102f8ce8f77`.\n- `git log --oneline main..feature/context-adapter-foundation` -> *(no output)*.\n- `git status --short src/context src/main.tsx src/main/index.ts src/preload/index.ts src/shared/shell-api.ts src/shared/state.ts src/shared/state.test.ts` -> modified/untracked files remain.\n- `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/context-adapter-foundation` -> *(no output)*.\n- `find src/context -type f | sort` -> context files exist only as local working-tree files.\n\n### Missing Artifacts Required For Closure\n1. Commit hash(es) on `feature/context-adapter-foundation`.\n2. Successful push output for `feature/context-adapter-foundation`.\n3. Remote head confirmation line from `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/context-adapter-foundation`.\n4. Attached command outputs for:\n   - `pnpm run test -- context`\n   - `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`\n\n### Actions Taken\n- Added a `Closure Audit (2026-02-17)` section to task note `302fcffa-...` with exact missing artifacts and required commands/outputs.\n- Updated task `302fcffa-...` status from `review_required` to `in_progress`.\n- Added a spec update section `Context Adapter Closure Check (2026-02-17)` documenting NO-GO and blocker state.\n\n### References\n- Task note: `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`\n- Spec: `spec`\n\n### Learnings\nPrior agent narrative can overstate completion when git artifacts are missing. Closure checks must validate branch delta and remote head explicitly, not just note prose.\n\n### Changes\n- Note updated: `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`\n- Note updated: `spec`\n- Note updated: `76dd55a0-e87d-4fc5-82bc-7878efc81bd5`","title":"Verify and close context-adapter task"}
