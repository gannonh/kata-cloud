Run-history closure task `374e17d5-6ac8-42ff-b943-66026957a892` reaches a terminal closure outcome (`complete`) with explicit GO/NO-GO recorded.\n2. Context task `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73` posts missing delivery artifacts (commit delta, successful push, remote ref, and test output) and is no longer blocked for closure.\n\n**Single Next Action**\nKeep browser task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f` in `waiting` and execute closure of run-history/context gates first; only after both gate conditions are met should browser task be resumed.\n\n**References**\n- `spec`\n- Task `374e17d5-6ac8-42ff-b943-66026957a892`\n- Task `76dd55a0-e87d-4fc5-82bc-7878efc81bd5`\n- Task `302fcffa-863d-4d90-b017-08369fad3f73`\n- Task `22770f24-a79b-4d14-9add-14ffd1447b2f`\n\n**Learnings**\nWhen closure ownership is duplicated, lock sequencing decisions to persisted task-note status/state rather than transient agent commentary.\n\n**Changes**\n- Note update only (no repository code/file edits).\n\n**Verification**\n- Cross-checked task metadata and closure evidence from task notes and active-agent conversations per this task’s verification plan.\n- No shell verification commands were required for this sequencing-only decision.","title":"Resolve browser-task sequencing and next action"}
