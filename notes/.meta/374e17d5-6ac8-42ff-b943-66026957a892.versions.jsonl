Run-history task note includes implementation artifact claims (files changed, automated checks, branch/commit).\n2. Remote head check passed for `feature/run-history-persistence-fix` at `4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`.\n\nEvidence gaps that block GO:\n1. No recorded verifier GO/NO-GO closeout for `c5f...`.\n2. Manual restart persistence verification remains explicitly blocked/unexecuted.\n3. Independent local inspection of commit `4d388ce...` was incomplete in this workspace (`git show` failed with `bad object`; fetch-based follow-up was not completed in this session).\n\nVerification commands run in this closure pass:\n1. `git branch --show-current` -> `feature/context-adapter-foundation`\n2. `git rev-parse HEAD` -> `1cadf1894f3a37d520c106af590ef102f8ce8f77`\n3. `git show --name-only --pretty=format: 4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6` -> `fatal: bad object 4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`\n4. `git ls-remote --heads origin feature/run-history-persistence-fix` -> remote head exists at `4d388ce411b3dc2b6df4591e47e67e944e7715a6`\n\nStatus action:\n- `c5f554ea-2059-40d2-9fb2-bf522a590cae` remains `in_progress` pending remediation.","title":"Verify and close run-history task"}
