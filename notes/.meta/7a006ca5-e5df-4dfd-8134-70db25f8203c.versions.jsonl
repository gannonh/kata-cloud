Recovery fetch and branch creation succeeded after zsh refspec fix using braces: `git fetch \"$BACKUP\" \"${REC_SHA}:refs/heads/${REC_BRANCH}\"`.\n2. Recovery checkout succeeded: `git switch recovered/git-stability-incident`.\n3. Commit parity confirmed locally at recovered tip: `fe3e028e5b5e7d7d273e011d5ae7e5483640b94c`.\n4. Repository health on recovered state was clean: `git fsck --full` completed without invalid refs; `git count-objects -vH` reported `garbage: 0`; `git worktree list --porcelain` showed only the active workspace worktree.\n5. Remote publication of full recovered pack failed repeatedly on transport/unpack corruption, then recovery content was published on resume branch via fresh-clone fallback path at `origin/feature/run-history-persistence` commit `be71982fc9e214b689eb529d3e9b2cb1f4d9b99c`.\n6. Local branch is now aligned to and tracking `origin/feature/run-history-persistence`.","title":"Recover pre-reset work into current workspace"}
