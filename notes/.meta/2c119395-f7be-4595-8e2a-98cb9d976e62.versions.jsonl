Conversion now persists task metadata so repeated saves of stale editor content reuse stable task IDs.\n+\n+## Acceptance Criteria Status\n+- ✅ Saving spec content via `saveSpecNote` converts `@@@task` blocks into `intent://local/task/...` links.\n+- ✅ Autosave/manual save call paths are covered because both route through `saveSpecNote`.\n+- ✅ Task IDs remain stable across repeated saves of identical task-block content (seeded from persisted task records).\n+- ✅ Added in-scope regression tests under `src/notes` for conversion + ID stability.\n+\n+## Changes\n+- `src/features/spec-panel/store.ts`: integrated task-block parse/sync into `saveSpecNote`; added persisted `tasks` support, task validation, and link/status synchronization.\n+- `src/features/spec-panel/types.ts`: added `SpecTaskRecord`/`SpecTaskStatus`; extended `SpecNoteDocument` with optional `tasks`.\n+- `src/features/spec-panel/index.ts`: exported new task-related types.\n+- `src/notes/types.ts`: re-exported new task-related types.\n+- `src/notes/store.test.ts`: added regression tests for save conversion and stable ID reuse.\n+- `src/notes/spec-note-panel.test.tsx`: updated autosave test to assert task-block conversion in persisted output.\n+\n+## Verification\n+- `pnpm run test -- notes` ❌ failed: `sh: vitest: command not found` (local `node_modules` missing).\n+- `pnpm install` ❌ failed: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND registry.npmjs.org` (network/DNS unavailable in this environment).\n+- Blocker: cannot execute Vitest verification until dependency install is possible in a network-enabled environment.\n+\n+## Learnings\n+- Because the live editor state may still contain `@@@task` content after a save, seeding conversion from persisted note tasks avoids ID churn on subsequent autosave/unmount saves without widening scope into UI state refactors."}
