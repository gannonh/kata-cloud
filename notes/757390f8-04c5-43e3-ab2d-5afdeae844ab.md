# Independent verification and incident closeout

Run an independent verifier pass across all Git-stability tasks and publish a GO/NO-GO decision.

## Scope
In scope: severity-ranked findings, residual risk assessment, final decision for resuming feature work.
Out of scope: additional feature coding.

## Inputs
- [Spec](intent://local/note/spec)
- Completed task notes for the three Git-stability tasks above.

## Definition of Done
- Verifier provides P0/P1/P2 findings (or explicit none).
- Verifier confirms whether feature work can safely resume.
- Spec is updated with incident outcome and next-step recommendation.

## Verification
- Verifier reruns core health commands and reviews guardrail/push workflow evidence.
- Final GO/NO-GO statement is recorded.

## Independent Verification Report (2026-02-17)

### Summary (Turn 1)
Re-ran required read-only git health checks and reviewed Task 1/2/3 notes plus commit scope evidence. Incident closeout is **NO-GO** because Acceptance Criterion #1 is still failing on a live `git count-objects -vH` garbage warning in shared worktree metadata.

### Acceptance Criteria
- ❌ AC1: Repository metadata integrity checks pass without invalid refs or garbage warnings.
  - `git fsck --full` had no invalid-ref errors, but `git count-objects -vH` still reports:
    - `warning: garbage found: /Users/gannonhall/dev/kata/kata-cloud/.git/worktrees/kata-cloud/refs`
    - `garbage: 1`
- ✅ AC2: Agents can publish scoped branches under canonical workflow.
  - Task 3 rehearsal evidence shows objective trigger detection on normal path and successful fresh-clone fallback push with remote ref verification.
  - Canonical workflow exists in both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- ✅ AC3: Guardrails prevent reintroduction of transient/cache/binary artifact pollution.
  - Commit `fe3e028` adds scoped guardrails (`.gitignore`, `package.json`, `bin/repo-guardrails.mjs`).
  - Independent rerun: dry-run pass on clean tree and expected detections on simulated forbidden paths.
- ⚠️ AC4: Independent verifier issues explicit GO before feature work resumes.
  - Verifier decision issued here is explicit **NO-GO** (GO cannot be issued while AC1 fails).

### Severity-Ranked Findings
- P0: Incident blocker still active (cannot resume feature work)
  - Evidence: live `git count-objects -vH` warning and non-zero garbage count in current workspace check.
  - Impact: Git metadata integrity acceptance criterion remains unmet.
- P1: Task-state mismatch may hide gate readiness
  - Evidence: spec task list marks Task 3 checked, but task note `68682ec1-e8c8-4178-a8aa-760ad433e4a5` is `review_required`.
  - Impact: coordination confusion on whether all prerequisite tasks are actually finalized.
- P2: None.

### Task 2/3 Evidence Completeness + Scope Boundaries
- Task 2 (`8de93595-feab-415f-9b77-731a6ac57abc`): evidence is complete and scoped.
  - Commit `fe3e028` touches only `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `bin/repo-guardrails.mjs`.
  - Verification evidence includes guardrail dry-run behavior plus typecheck/test output in note.
- Task 3 (`68682ec1-e8c8-4178-a8aa-760ad433e4a5`): evidence is complete and scoped.
  - Commit `1773a1a` touches only `AGENTS.md`.
  - Rehearsal includes objective trigger match, fallback push success, and remote ref verification.

### Commands Run
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir
git rev-parse --git-common-dir
git fsck --full
git count-objects -vH
git worktree list --porcelain
git status --short --branch
git log --oneline -n 12
git show --name-status --stat --oneline fe3e028
git show --name-status --stat --oneline 1773a1a
pnpm run repo:guardrails -- --dry-run
pnpm run repo:guardrails -- --dry-run --path=.pnpm-store/v3/files/simulated-index --path=tmp/.DS_Store
```

### Final Recommendation
- **NO-GO** for resuming feature work.
- Required escalated cleanup action before re-verification:
  - `rmdir /Users/gannonhall/dev/kata/kata-cloud/.git/worktrees/kata-cloud/refs`
- After cleanup, re-run:
  - `git fsck --full`
  - `git count-objects -vH`
  - `git worktree list --porcelain`
- Gate can move to GO only when `git count-objects -vH` has no garbage warning and `garbage: 0`.

## Independent Re-Verification (2026-02-17, post-manual cleanup)

### Summary (Turn 2)
Re-ran required closeout commands against current repository state and reviewed Task 2/Task 3 evidence plus commit scope. Incident gate is now **GO** for resuming feature work.

### Required Command Outputs (exact)

git fsck --full

```

### AC Traceability + Verification
- ✅ AC1: Repository metadata integrity checks pass without invalid refs or garbage warnings.
  - Evidence: required rerun above shows no garbage warning line and `garbage: 0`; `git fsck --full` has no invalid-ref errors.
- ✅ AC2: Agents can publish scoped branches under canonical workflow.
  - Evidence: Task `68682ec1-e8c8-4178-a8aa-760ad433e4a5` rehearsal includes objective trigger detection on normal path plus successful fresh-clone fallback push and remote ref verification.
- ✅ AC3: Guardrails prevent reintroduction of transient/cache/binary artifact pollution.
  - Evidence: Task `8de93595-feab-415f-9b77-731a6ac57abc`, commit `fe3e028`, and current rerun `pnpm run repo:guardrails -- --dry-run` => PASS.
- ✅ AC4: Independent verifier issues explicit GO before feature work resumes.
  - Evidence: explicit decision in this note: **GO**.

### Severity-Ranked Findings
- P0: None.
- P1: None.
- P2: Informational only: `git fsck --full` still reports dangling tree objects; this is not an invalid-ref or garbage-warning failure condition.

### Additional Evidence Checks
- Guardrail rerun:
  - `pnpm run repo:guardrails -- --dry-run` => `[repo-guardrails] PASS: no forbidden artifact paths found.`
- Canonical workflow presence check:
  - `rg -n "Push Reliability Workflow \(Incident Canonical\)|bad record mac|Fresh-Clone Fallback Path" AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`
  - Matches found in both `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Commit scope checks:
  - `git show --name-status --stat --oneline fe3e028` => `.gitignore`, `package.json`, `bin/repo-guardrails.mjs`
  - `git show --name-status --stat --oneline 1773a1a` => `AGENTS.md` only

### Final Decision
- **GO**: incident closeout criteria are met; feature work may resume.
