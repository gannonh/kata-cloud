title: "Specialist Agents"
description: "The six agent personas that execute work in Kata Cloud, each designed for a specific type of task."
---

## Overview

Kata Cloud uses a **team of specialized agents** rather than a single general-purpose model. This mirrors how engineering teams actually work: different people (and agents) excel at different tasks. The Coordination Agent decides which specialist to use for each task based on the Spec.

Every specialist agent runs in its own context window and can work in parallel with other specialists.

## The Six Specialists

### Investigate

**Purpose**: Explore the codebase, assess feasibility, and gather context before implementation.

**When it's used**:
- Before implementation tasks, to understand existing patterns
- When the Orchestrator needs to assess the impact of a change
- To answer questions like "how does the existing auth system work?"

**What it produces**:
- A summary of relevant code structure
- Notes on constraints and dependencies
- Recommendations for implementation approach

---

### Implement

**Purpose**: Execute implementation plans — write, modify, and delete code.

**When it's used**:
- After investigation tasks have gathered sufficient context
- To build new features, refactor existing code, or fix bugs
- For any task that requires writing production code

**What it produces**:
- Modified or new source files
- Updated configuration files
- Code that follows the patterns discovered during investigation

---

### Verify

**Purpose**: Check that implementations match specifications and that code is correct.

**When it's used**:
- After implementation tasks complete
- To confirm that the Spec's requirements are actually met
- To run existing tests and flag failures

**What it produces**:
- A verification report against the Spec's acceptance criteria
- Test results (pass/fail)
- A list of gaps between what was implemented and what was required

---

### Critique

**Purpose**: Review specifications for feasibility, completeness, and potential issues — before implementation begins.

**When it's used**:
- After a Spec draft is generated but before agents start executing
- To catch ambiguous requirements, missing edge cases, or infeasible designs
- As a quality gate on the Spec itself (not the code)

**What it produces**:
- Identified risks and gaps in the Spec
- Questions or clarifications for the human developer
- Suggested refinements to the Spec

---

### Debug

**Purpose**: Analyze failures, identify root causes, and fix issues.

**When it's used**:
- When Verify agents report failures
- When implementation agents produce code that doesn't work
- When existing tests break after a change

**What it produces**:
- Root cause analysis of the failure
- A fix for the identified problem
- Notes on why the failure occurred

---

### Code Review

**Purpose**: Automated code review with categorized feedback on quality, style, and correctness.

**When it's used**:
- After implementation tasks, as a quality gate before PR creation
- To surface issues that would block a human code review
- To enforce project conventions and best practices

**What it produces**:
- Categorized review feedback (errors, warnings, suggestions)
- Severity-rated issues (blocking, major, minor, style)
- Inline annotations for specific code sections

---

## Task Assignment

The Coordination Agent assigns tasks to specialists based on:

1. **Task type**: `implement`, `verify`, or `debug` task types map directly to specialist personas
2. **Spec context**: The content of each task block in the Spec guides the specialist choice
3. **Dependencies**: Tasks that depend on each other run in sequence; independent tasks run in parallel

## Parallel Execution

When multiple tasks have no interdependencies, specialists run simultaneously:

```
Wave 1: [Investigate] → analyzes codebase
Wave 2: [Implement A] + [Implement B] → run in parallel
Wave 3: [Verify]      → checks both implementations
Wave 4: [Code Review] → reviews combined result
```

This significantly reduces wall-clock time for complex features.

## Custom Specialists

You can create **custom specialist personas** in Settings to tailor agents to your workflow:

- Define the agent's name and purpose
- Set the system prompt that shapes its behavior
- Assign it to specific task types

Custom specialists follow the same execution model as built-in ones.

## Model Assignment

Different task types can be routed to different models:

| Task Type | Recommended Model |
|---|---|
| Complex architecture (Investigate, Critique) | Opus 4.5 |
| Implementation, debugging | Sonnet 4.5 |
| Verification, code review | GPT 5.2 or Haiku |

Configure model routing in **Settings → Model Profiles**.
