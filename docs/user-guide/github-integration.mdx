## Overview

Kata Cloud integrates with GitHub to complete the workflow from specification to merged pull request. The integration handles:

- **Branch management** — creating and pushing Space branches
- **PR creation** — opening pull requests with agent-generated content
- **PR descriptions** — auto-generated from Spec and run history

## Connecting GitHub

Before creating your first pull request, authenticate with GitHub:

1. Open the **Changes tab**
2. Click **Create PR** on any Space with staged changes
3. If not yet connected, click **Connect GitHub**
4. You'll be redirected to GitHub's OAuth authorization page
5. Authorize Kata Cloud to access your repositories
6. Return to Kata Cloud — the connection is established

<Note>
Kata Cloud stores your GitHub session securely on your local machine. Your credentials are never sent to Kata Cloud servers — the connection is direct from your desktop to GitHub's API.
</Note>

## Creating a Pull Request

Once connected to GitHub, creating a PR takes a few clicks:

### 1. Stage Your Changes

In the Changes tab, stage the files you want to include in the PR. See [Changes Tab](/user-guide/changes-tab) for staging details.

### 2. Open the PR Workflow

Click **Create PR** in the Changes tab toolbar.

### 3. Generate a Description

Click **Generate Description** to let Kata Cloud draft the PR description. The agent synthesizes:

- The Spec's goal and requirements
- The tasks that were completed
- The implementation decisions recorded in the Spec
- A summary of the key code changes

You can edit the generated description freely before submitting.

### 4. Submit

Click **Submit PR** to:
1. Commit your staged changes to the Space's branch
2. Push the branch to the remote repository
3. Open a GitHub pull request
4. Return the PR URL for immediate review

## Branch Naming

Each Space maps to one git branch. By default, Kata Cloud names branches based on the Space name:

```
kata/add-user-authentication
kata/fix-dashboard-performance
kata/refactor-api-layer
```

You can rename a Space (and its branch) before pushing if you prefer a different naming convention.

## Repository Setup

For PR creation to work:

- The Space's **Root Path** must point to a local git repository
- The repository must have a **remote** configured (e.g., `origin`)
- Your GitHub account must have **push access** to the remote repository

If you're starting with a new repo, initialize it with `git init` and add a remote before creating your first Space:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
```

## Clearing the GitHub Session

To disconnect from GitHub or switch accounts:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Clear GitHub Session**
3. The next PR creation will prompt you to re-authenticate

## Privacy and Security

- OAuth tokens are stored locally using Electron's secure storage
- No code or credentials are transmitted to Kata Cloud servers
- API calls go directly from your machine to GitHub's API
- Kata Cloud requests only the minimum GitHub permissions needed for PR creation

## What's Not Yet Supported

The following GitHub features are on the roadmap but not yet available:

- **Reviewing PRs inside Kata Cloud** — you'll review on GitHub.com
- **Linear integration** — connecting GitHub issues to Linear cycles
- **PR review agents** — 6-agent parallel PR review suite (planned for Phase 2)
- **CI status display** — showing GitHub Actions results in the Changes tab

See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gannonh/kata-cloud/issues) to track progress or request features.
