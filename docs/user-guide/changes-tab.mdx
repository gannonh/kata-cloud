description: "Inspect diffs, stage files, and create pull requests from agent-generated code."

## Overview

The **Changes tab** is where you review everything agents produced and prepare it for merge. It's a built-in git client that shows you:

- Every file modified, added, or deleted by agents
- Side-by-side diffs for each changed file
- Staged vs. unstaged status
- Tools to create a GitHub pull request

Navigate to the Changes tab by clicking **Changes** in the top navigation bar.

## File List

The left panel shows all changed files in the current Space, grouped by status:

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **Modified** | Files that existed and were changed |
| **Added** | New files created by agents |
| **Deleted** | Files removed by agents |
| **Staged** | Files queued for the PR |
| **Unstaged** | Files with changes not yet included |

Click any file to open its diff in the right panel.

## Diff Viewer

The diff viewer shows a **side-by-side comparison** of the original and modified versions of each file:

- **Left side**: the original file (before agent changes)
- **Right side**: the modified file (after agent changes)
- Additions are highlighted in green, deletions in red
- Unchanged context lines are shown in gray

The diff viewer supports **syntax highlighting** for 20+ programming languages using CodeMirror.

### Navigating Large Diffs

For files with many changes:
- Use the scroll bar to navigate
- Changed hunks are visually separated
- The file header shows the total number of additions and deletions

## Staging Files

Before creating a PR, select which files to include by **staging** them:

### Stage a File
Click the **+** icon next to any unstaged file to stage it.

### Unstage a File
Click the **−** icon next to any staged file to remove it from the staging area.

### Stage All / Unstage All
Use the **Stage All** and **Unstage All** buttons at the top of the file list to quickly manage all files.

<Note>
Staging in Kata Cloud mirrors `git add` / `git restore --staged`. Only staged files will be included in the pull request.
</Note>

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you've staged the files you want:

1. Click **Create PR** in the Changes tab toolbar
2. Kata Cloud opens the **PR workflow panel**

### GitHub Authentication

The first time you create a PR, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub:
1. Click **Connect GitHub**
2. Follow the OAuth flow in your browser
3. Authorize Kata Cloud to access your repositories

### PR Description

Kata Cloud can **auto-generate a comprehensive PR description** based on:
- The Spec content (goals, tasks, decisions)
- The diff of changed files
- The Orchestrator run history

Click **Generate Description** to let an agent write the PR description. You can edit the generated text before submitting.

### Submitting the PR

Review the title and description, then click **Submit PR**. Kata Cloud:
1. Creates a commit with your staged changes
2. Pushes the Space's branch to the remote repository
3. Opens a GitHub pull request
4. Returns the PR URL so you can view it directly

## Inspecting Agent Work

### Understanding What Agents Changed

Before merging, review each diff carefully:

- Look for files you didn't expect agents to touch
- Check that changes match what the Spec described
- Verify that existing tests still make sense with the new code
- Confirm that code style matches your project conventions

### Agent Commit Messages

Agents create commits with descriptive messages following conventional commit format:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token generation utility
fix(middleware): handle expired tokens with 401 response
test(auth): add unit tests for token utilities
```

## Tips

**Review before staging**: Don't just stage everything at once. Read through the diffs to catch unexpected changes or mistakes.

**Partial PRs are fine**: You can stage a subset of changed files and create a PR for just that part. Leave the rest staged for a follow-up run.

**Use the Spec to verify**: Cross-reference the Changes tab against the Spec's task list. Every completed task in the Spec should have corresponding changes visible here.

**Auto-generated PR descriptions save time**: The agent-generated description typically covers everything a human reviewer needs — what changed, why, and how to test it.
