## Prerequisites

Before installing Kata Cloud, you'll need an API key or subscription from at least one model provider:

- **Anthropic**: [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) — API key, or a Claude Max subscription
- **OpenAI**: [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) — API key, or a ChatGPT Plus/Pro subscription

Kata Cloud is **free to use**. Your API key covers the model costs at published provider rates.

## Download and Install

1. Visit [kata.sh](https://kata.sh) and download the macOS installer
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag **Kata Cloud** to your Applications folder
3. Launch Kata Cloud from Applications

<Note>
Linux support is coming soon. Windows support is on the roadmap.

## Create Your First Space

A **Space** is an isolated development environment with its own git branch and worktree. Every agent workflow starts by creating a Space.

1. Open Kata Cloud — you'll see the **Explorer** panel on the left
2. Click **New Space** (or type your intent in the prompt box)
3. Describe what you want to build or change — for example:
   > "Add user authentication with email and password to this Express app"
4. Choose a **name** and **location** for the Space
5. Optionally link a Git repository and add tags for organization
6. Click **Create Space**

Kata Cloud creates a new git branch and worktree for your Space, then opens the Orchestrator.

## Your First Orchestrator Run

When a Space opens, you'll see three panels:

| Panel | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Explorer** (left) | Your files and spaces |
| **Orchestrator** (center) | Agent run status and activity |
| **Spec** (right) | The living specification document |

The Orchestrator automatically:
1. Analyzes your codebase to understand the context
2. Drafts a **Spec** — a structured document describing goals, tasks, and approach
3. Proposes tasks for Specialist Agents

### Review and Apply the Spec Draft

Before agents start executing, you can:
- **Review the Spec draft** to confirm the approach
- **Edit the Spec** to adjust scope, add constraints, or clarify requirements
- Click **Apply Draft** to accept the Spec and kick off agent execution

<Tip>
You can stop the Orchestrator at any time by clicking **Stop**. Edit the Spec manually, then resume — giving you full control over the direction of the work.
</Tip>

## Review Changes and Create a PR

When agents complete their work, navigate to the **Changes** tab:

1. Click **Changes** in the top navigation
2. Inspect diffs — see exactly what each agent changed
3. Stage the files you want to include
4. Click **Create PR**
5. The agent auto-generates a comprehensive PR description
6. Review and submit to GitHub

That's the complete Kata Cloud workflow: **Prompt → Space → Spec → Agents → Changes → PR**.
