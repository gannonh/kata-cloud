## What is a Space?

A **Space** is Kata Cloud's core unit of work. Every Space has:

- A dedicated **git branch** and **worktree** — agents work in isolation without affecting your main branch
- A **Spec** — the living document driving all agent work
- **Orchestrator run history** — a complete record of every agent session
- **Metadata** — name, description, tags, and linked repository

When you create a Space from a prompt, Kata Cloud automatically sets up the git worktree and hands off to the Orchestrator. When you're done, merge the PR and the Space has done its job.

## Creating a Space

### From the Prompt Box

1. Type your intent in the **prompt box** on the home screen
2. Press **Create Space** (or `Enter`)
3. Set a name, choose a directory on your filesystem, and optionally link a Git repository
4. Click **Create**

### Space Metadata

When creating or editing a Space, you can set:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | A short, descriptive label (e.g., "add-auth", "fix-dashboard-perf") |
| **Description** | Longer context about the purpose of this Space |
| **Root Path** | The local directory where the worktree lives |
| **Repository URL** | Optional GitHub repository link for PR creation |
| **Tags** | Custom labels for filtering and organization |

## Managing Spaces

The **Explorer** panel (left sidebar) lists all your Spaces. From here you can:

- **Switch** between active Spaces
- **Archive** completed Spaces
- **Delete** Spaces you no longer need

### Space Status

Each Space displays a git lifecycle status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `initializing` | Kata Cloud is creating the worktree and branch |
| `switching` | The Space is loading after you selected it |
| `ready` | The Space is active and agents can run |
| `error` | Something went wrong — check the error message |

## Git Worktrees

Kata Cloud uses **git worktrees** to give every Space its own isolated filesystem. This is what makes parallel work possible:

- Each Space has a separate directory on disk (the worktree)
- Multiple Spaces can work on the same repository at the same time
- There's no branch switching — each worktree always reflects its own branch
- Cleanup is automatic when you delete a Space

### Why Worktrees (Not Branches)?

Traditional branch workflows require switching branches to see changes — which clears your working state and can be disruptive. Worktrees solve this by maintaining multiple physical copies of the repo at different branches simultaneously.

When you have three Spaces for the same repo, you have three separate directories, each with its own branch, all open at once.

## Sessions

Within a Space, you can have multiple **Sessions** — named work contexts that preserve state across Orchestrator runs. Sessions let you:

- Organize work thematically within a Space
- Keep separate Orchestrator histories for different sub-tasks
- Resume previous work exactly where you left off

### Creating Sessions

1. Open a Space from the Explorer
2. Click **+ New Session** in the Orchestrator panel
3. Give the session a label

## Resumable Sessions

Kata Cloud persists your entire Space state to disk (`~/.config/kata-cloud/kata-cloud-state.json`). When you close and reopen the app:

- Your active Space, Session, and view are restored
- Orchestrator run history is preserved
- The Spec retains all content and comments

You can pick up any agent workflow exactly where you left it.

## Tags and Organization

Tags let you categorize Spaces across projects. For example:

- `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`
- `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`
- `v1.0`, `sprint-3`

Filter your Space list by tag using the Explorer's search and filter controls.
