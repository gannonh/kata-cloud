## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. It lets Kata Cloud agents access databases, documentation, APIs, and other resources without leaving the app.

MCP is widely adopted — GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, and dozens of other tools use MCP for tool integration. Apple adopted MCP in Xcode in early 2026. Kata Cloud implements MCP as a **client**, meaning it can consume any MCP server.

## How MCP Works in Kata Cloud

When agents run in Kata Cloud, they have access to:

1. **Built-in coding tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep (provided by the Agent SDK)
2. **MCP tool servers**: External tools you configure

MCP servers provide additional capabilities — for example:
- A database MCP server lets agents query your schema directly
- A documentation MCP server gives agents access to your API docs
- A filesystem MCP server exposes files outside the Space's worktree
- A web search MCP server lets agents look up current information

## Configuring MCP Servers

MCP server configuration follows the standard MCP spec. In Kata Cloud:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Navigate to **MCP Servers**
3. Add a server configuration

Each MCP server entry includes:
- **Name**: A label for this server
- **Command**: The executable to run (e.g., `npx`, `uvx`, `python`)
- **Arguments**: Command-line arguments for the server
- **Environment**: Optional environment variables (e.g., API keys)

### Example: Database MCP Server

```json
{
  "name": "postgres",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
}
```

### Example: Filesystem MCP Server

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/Users/you/shared-docs"]
}
```

### Example: GitHub MCP Server

```json
{
  "name": "github",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
  }
}
```

## Tool Discovery

When an Orchestrator run starts, Kata Cloud:
1. Connects to all configured MCP servers
2. Discovers available tools from each server
3. Makes those tools available to all agents in the run

Agents can then call MCP tools the same way they use built-in tools.

## Kata Context Direction

Kata Cloud's longer-term context architecture is **Kata Context**: a shared context platform for agents and apps.

### Context Engine MCP

Kata Context will expose high-quality retrieval through MCP so external tools can consume the same context quality used in Kata workflows.

### Context Engine SDK

Kata Context is planned to provide SDKs for building context-aware agents and apps with:
- Local filesystem indexing
- Direct indexing from non-filesystem sources
- Typed retrieval APIs for app integration

### Context Connectors

Kata Context connectors are intended to index and search sources such as:
- GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket repositories
- Documentation websites and runbooks
- Schemas, configs, and local project files

Connector-backed indexes are designed for use through CLI, SDK, HTTP, and MCP interfaces.

## Tool Annotations

Kata Cloud respects MCP tool annotations:

| Annotation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `readOnlyHint` | The tool doesn't modify state — safe to run automatically |
| `destructiveHint` | The tool may modify or delete data — may require confirmation |

## Security Considerations

- MCP servers run as subprocesses on your machine under your user account
- Treat MCP server dependencies with the same care as any npm/pip package
- Use environment variables for secrets — don't put API keys in command arguments
- Agents with MCP tool access have the same filesystem and network permissions as any local process

## Coming Soon: Kata as an MCP Server

Future versions of Kata Cloud will expose the **Kata workflow engine as an MCP server** — allowing external tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot to invoke Kata workflows via MCP. This turns Kata from a standalone app into an orchestration layer that the entire agentic ecosystem can use.

## Finding MCP Servers

The MCP ecosystem is growing rapidly. Useful resources:

- [MCP server repository](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) — official reference implementations
- [Smithery](https://smithery.ai) — curated MCP server registry
- Community-maintained lists on the [MCP Discord](https://discord.gg/mcp)
