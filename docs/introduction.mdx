## What is Kata Cloud?

Kata Cloud is a **spec-driven development platform** where you orchestrate AI agent teams rather than write code directly. Describe what you want to build, and Kata's Orchestrator analyzes your codebase, drafts a living specification, and dispatches specialized agents to implement it — all producing a clean pull request as output.

## Core Concepts

### Spec-Driven Development

Instead of writing code and hoping it matches the plan, you write a spec and let agents implement it. As they work, the spec updates to reflect what was actually built — keeping agents and developers aligned automatically.

### Spaces

Every prompt creates a **Space**: an isolated git branch and worktree where agents can work without touching your main branch. Spaces give you clean separation between concurrent experiments and features.

### The Orchestrator

When you submit a prompt, Kata's **Coordination Agent**:
1. Analyzes your codebase for context
2. Drafts a **Spec** — a living document describing goals, tasks, decisions, and progress
3. Delegates tasks to **Specialist Agents** (Investigate, Implement, Verify, Critique, Debug, Code Review)

### Pull Request as Output

Every Kata Cloud workflow produces an atomic pull request. The PR is the deliverable — not a pile of uncommitted files. Review diffs in the **Changes tab**, auto-generate a PR description, and push to GitHub in one click.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Space Management** | Multiple isolated environments with metadata, tags, and git integration |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordination Agent + 6 Specialist Agents working in parallel |
| **The Spec** | Self-maintaining project document that updates as agents work |
| **Changes Tab** | Visual diff viewer with selective staging and one-click PR creation |
| **GitHub Integration** | Branch management, PR creation, and auto-generated descriptions |
| **MCP Support** | Connect external tool servers to extend agent capabilities |
| **Resumable Sessions** | Persistent state — pick up exactly where you left off |
| **Notes** | Markdown notes with tags and full-text search |

## Architecture at a Glance

Kata Cloud is an **Electron desktop app** with a React 19 renderer. All agent work runs locally — your code never leaves your machine unless you push to GitHub. Model API calls go directly from your machine to Anthropic or OpenAI using your own API keys or subscriptions.

```
Your Machine
├── Kata Cloud Desktop App (Electron + React)
│   ├── Space Management
│   ├── Orchestrator UI
│   ├── Spec Panel
│   └── Changes Tab
├── Git Worktrees (local filesystem)
└── Model Provider Auth (Anthropic / OpenAI)
```

**Local mode is free** — Kata Cloud uses your existing model provider API keys or subscriptions (Claude Max, ChatGPT Plus/Pro). You pay only for the tokens your agents consume.
