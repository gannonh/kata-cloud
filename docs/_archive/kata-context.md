Context Engine MCP
Plug Context Engine into any agent via the Model Context Protocol

Context Engine SDK
Build context-aware custom agents or apps using our TypeScript or Python SDK
  
Context Connectors
Index any source and make it searchable via CLI, MCP, or HTTP

### Context Engine MCP

Plug Context Engine into any agent, such as Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and more via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Perfect for:**

* Using Augment's context in your favorite AI tools
* Enriching any coding agent or AI with state-of-the-art codebase semantic search

### Context Engine SDK

Build context-aware custom agents or apps using our TypeScript or Python SDK.

The SDK provides **FileSystem Context** to index local directories or **Direct Context** to index files from any source.

**Perfect for:**

* Building custom AI agents with codebase understanding
* Creating applications that need to understand codebase, documentation, specifications, runbooks, and other text sources
* Achieving state-of-the-art context quality in AI-powered code review, security scanning, failure analysis, migrations, and more ...

### Context Connectors

An open-source library built on the Context Engine SDK that makes diverse sources searchable across agents and apps. Index code, documentation, runbooks, schemas, and configs from GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, websites, or local filesystem. Store indexes locally or in S3. Search via CLI, interactive agent, or MCP server.

**Perfect for:**

* Indexing repositories without cloning them locally
* Building applications with persistent indexes stored in S3
* Auto-indexing on every push via webhooks
* Indexing documentation websites
