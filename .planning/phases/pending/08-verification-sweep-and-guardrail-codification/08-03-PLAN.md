<objective>
Capture VERI-03 quality-gate evidence and finalize Phase 8 verification artifacts.

Purpose: Turn completed automated/UAT runs into auditable milestone evidence and update project planning state accordingly.
Output: Quality-gate evidence files, requirement status updates, and roadmap/state alignment.
</objective>

Run the Phase 8 quality-gate command set and capture outcomes with timestamps and status:
- `pnpm run test:orchestrator-context` (from Plan 01)
- `pnpm test`
- `pnpm run desktop:typecheck`
- `pnpm run e2e:electron:smoke`
- `pnpm run e2e:electron:uat`

Record pass/fail, key notes, and artifact pointers (including `output/playwright/` screenshot/log evidence) in `08-VERIFICATION.md`.

  <verify>
    All commands exit 0.
    Verification file includes a command-by-command evidence table.

Create/update `08-UAT.md` with:
- integrated orchestrator/context scenario results,
- total/pass/fail counts,
- observed issues/gaps.

Update `08-VERIFICATION.md` to include explicit VERI mapping:
- VERI-01 -> focused automated suite evidence.
- VERI-02 -> integrated Electron scenario evidence.
- VERI-03 -> quality gate evidence.

If all VERI requirements pass, mark `VERI-01`, `VERI-02`, and `VERI-03` complete in `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`.

    UAT and verification docs both include totals and requirement traceability.

If verification artifacts show full pass, update planning state:
- Mark Phase 8 complete in `.planning/ROADMAP.md` with completion date.
- Update milestone progress and next-step posture in `.planning/STATE.md`.
- Preserve concise accumulated context notes that reference verification completion and any follow-up gaps.

Do not claim completion if any required gate failed.

    Roadmap and state reflect the same Phase 8 status as verification documents.

<verification>
- All required quality gates pass.
- UAT and verification artifacts include explicit evidence and counts.
- Requirements, roadmap, and state files align with verification results.

<success_criteria>
- VERI-03 has explicit command-level evidence captured.
- VERI-01/02/03 are traceable from requirements to UAT/verification artifacts.
- Project planning state is consistent and milestone-handoff ready.
