# State

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 8 (Verification Sweep and Guardrail Codification) — milestone complete
Plan: All plans complete
Status: Between milestones — v0.1.0 shipped, UI specs produced, next milestone not yet started
Last activity: 2026-02-19 — UI specifications generated from design mocks

## Milestone Progress

Progress: 4/4 phases complete (100%)
Bar: [####################] SHIPPED

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-02-19)

Core value: The spec remains aligned with implementation while agent execution consistently yields reviewable pull requests.
Current focus: Planning next milestone using UI spec gap analysis as input

## Milestone Scope Issues

No backlog issues selected yet for this milestone scope.

## Accumulated Context

- v0.1.0 shipped with deterministic orchestrator lifecycle, typed context contracts, and interrupted-run recovery.
- All 14 requirements satisfied. 2 non-critical tech debt items documented in milestone audit.
- Provider runtime and PR workflow foundations remain validated from prior work.
- UAT-to-E2E policy remains active: manual UAT outcomes must be codified into Playwright coverage.
- UI specifications produced from 29 design mocks across 7 feature areas (`docs/design/specs/`). Cross-cutting gaps identified: chat-style conversation renderer, agent sidebar, wave grouping model, terminal/browser tabs, permission dialog, commit interface, markdown rendering in spec panel.
