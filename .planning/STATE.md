## Milestone Scope Issues

No backlog issues selected yet for this milestone scope.

## Accumulated Context

- Provider runtime and PR workflow foundations are already present and validated.
- Phase 5 delivered deterministic run lifecycle transitions, shared run/task projections, and renderer wiring for lifecycle/status display.
- ORCH-01 and ORCH-02 are now complete and reflected in requirements traceability.
- Orchestrator lifecycle + context adapter baseline now has deterministic status semantics; next work is delegated history + context contract hardening.
- UAT-to-E2E policy remains active: manual UAT outcomes must be codified into Playwright coverage.
