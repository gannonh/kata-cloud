No backlog issues selected yet for this milestone scope.

## Accumulated Context

- Provider runtime and PR workflow foundations are already present and validated.
- Phase 5 delivered deterministic run lifecycle transitions, shared run/task projections, and renderer wiring for lifecycle/status display.
- Phase 6 delivered typed context retrieval contracts, structured context IPC diagnostics, and recoverable run-history persistence semantics.
- ORCH-01, ORCH-02, ORCH-03, ORCH-04, CTX-01, and CTX-02 are now complete and reflected in requirements traceability.
- Next focus is restart/resume integrity and context consistency guarantees in repeated session flows (Phase 7).
- UAT-to-E2E policy remains active: manual UAT outcomes must be codified into Playwright coverage.
